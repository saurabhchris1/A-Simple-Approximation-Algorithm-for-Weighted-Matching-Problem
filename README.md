# A-Simple-Approximation-Algorithm-for-Weighted-Matching-Problem

A graph is a made up of Edges and Vertices. The code uses Edge class to represent
the edges between the nodes in a graph.
The Edge class has following functions:
Ø setWeight () to set the edge weight between vertices.
Ø getWeight () to get the edge weight.
Ø Constructor () which takes in edge weight, vertex 1 and vertex 2 as parameter.
Ø getVertexOne () and getVertexTwo () to get the respective vertex.
Ø setVertexOne () and setVertexTwo () to set the respective vertex.
The Graph class has following functions:
Ø getEdge () and setEdges () to get and set the edges respectively.
Ø getVertices and setVertices to get and set the vertices respectively.
Ø Graph () constructor which takes in parameter the number of vertices and an
array list of edges.
Ø getHeaviestEdge () to get the edge incident to the vertex which has the highest
edge weight.
Ø getVertexWeight () to get degree of vertex.
Ø weight () calculates the weight of M1 and M2.
Ø remove () deletes the vertex and incident edges.
The Main class:
Ø pathGrowingAlgorithm () to implement the algorithm.
